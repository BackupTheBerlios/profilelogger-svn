You need the Qt toolkit from trolltech (now nokia) available from (it also
includes the mingw compiler and support tools as of writing this in the windows
download):

http://qt.nokia.com.

Install it and type the following commands in a shell (the binaries are then in
the bin/ subdirectory):

linux/unix:
    cd profilelogger
    qmake profilelogger.pro
    make

mac:
    cd profilelogger
    qmake -spec macx-g++ profilelogger.pro
    make

windows:
    cd profilelogger
    qmake profilelogger.pr
    <where mingw-make is>
   
If you want to compile setup.exe you need Inno Setup. Open the file windows.iss in the directory setups and compile the file. This will yield setup.exe.
